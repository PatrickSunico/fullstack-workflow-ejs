#1 To get started with the build system We need to install dependencies first from bower and npm.

```
npm install 
```

```
bower install
```

#2 With our gulpfile already built with their specific tasks, we need to compile our assets and build our templates. (we execute this in order);

Compile our assets
```
gulp compile
```

Build our ejs templates
```
gulp build
```

#3 Run our default gulp task by simply just typing in gulp in the command line, And then we are ready to make a website
```
gulp
```
